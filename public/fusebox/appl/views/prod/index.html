    <h3>Application Acceptance Testing</h3>
    <p class="f16">
        This Demo Application uses CanJS(https://canjs.com/index.html) Javascript libraries to route, load and process HTML. The presentation is based on Bootstrap 4-beta2.
        Testing is accomplished by injecting Jasmine specs in the application running within a Karma test-runner environment. 
        Generally the specs are coded by the developer in a test driven environment. However the tests can be isolated from the application code and loaded in a single
        location(see index.js).  This allows test and production groups to develop end to end testing. Note that the application does need code to accommodate a URL 
        modification to run under Karma. Please review the included readme.
